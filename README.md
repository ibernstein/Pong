# Pong

This is the individual Final Project for my Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Design course at Wash U (Fall 2014); a course that helped develop advanced skills in both front and backend web design. I created a version of Pong, the classic arcade game, that can be played with two players on the same computer or over a network on two seperate computers. The two players have the ability to compete. The project is based in JavaScript and uses Socket.io and Node.js to allow for the two player functionality, both on a single computer and over a network using two computers.
